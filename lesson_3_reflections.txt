When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1) for sharing/ swopping of code
2) allow code to be reviewed
3) security
4) Alternative computer access say home and at work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To make sure your at a logical unit of change


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

      a branch is an alternative 'path' of code that has been split off say the master branch that has its own commits. It may be merged back into onother branch at some future date.

      A clone is a copy of a repository including all its git files, commits etc.

      A fork is a github clone. Cloning your remote repositories on github is a fork if you want that clone to be an independant copy of the original allowing you to push to it without requiring permission from the original repository for example.
  
  
  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
