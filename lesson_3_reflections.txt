When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1) for sharing/ swopping of code
2) allow code to be reviewed
3) security
4) Alternative computer access say home and at work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To make sure your at a logical unit of change
